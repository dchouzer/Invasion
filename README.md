====

First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2014

Genre: The genre will be a puzzle/shooter game.
    There will be a timed maze for the first level and a scroll-down shooter
    for the second level.
    
Name: Invasion

Goal:

In order to advance to the second level, the protagonist stay alive for a long enough period of time.
During the first level, enemies will stream down and the player must either avoid or shoot them.
    
In order to beat the second level, however, the protagonist must
fight another opponent to the death.
    
Basic Mechanics:
    
The player should only need to shoot (Z) or move with the arrow keys (Up/Down/Left/Right).

Note that in the second level, the boss is able to teleport. Stay away from the boss.
    
Cheat Codes

There are two possible cheat codes.
1) Holding "C" enables the player to fire an infinite number of times.
2) Holding "X" enables the player to become invincible, avoiding all attacks.
            
If the user fails to reach the next stage, the map will be reset
and the start screen will reappear, allowing the user
to decide whether he/she would like to play the game again.
            
If the user dies before killing the boss, the screen will be
reset to the initial screen and the user will have the option
of playing the game again.
